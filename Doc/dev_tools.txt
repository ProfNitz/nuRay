- Python Environment: Anaconda (updated monthly) and Spyder (preferably) as IDE
- Modern CSV for editing psv (pipe separated values), e.g. TODO.psv (https://www.moderncsv.com/download/)

	- 2021_03:
		- conda would not install pyqt5 by "conda install pyqt5"
		- "pip install pyqt5" breaks the environment
		- solution: new environment (python=3.8), then pip install pyqt5 pyqt5-tools
		- designer then found under Lib\site-packages\pyqt5-applications
